          Throughout my childhood, I had a fascination with computers.
          I was enthralled with their inner workings, and what made them <i>tick. </i>
          During secondary school, I started to teach myself different programming languages, 
          trying new languages and new techniques for any project that I could think of.
          Eventually, I was hired to create a web site, which brought me to the long path of web development.

        <p>The first time I was actually <i>taught </i>
          a programming language was in 10th grade.
          Visual Basic will always be sentimental to me,
          however I will probably never use it in practice.
